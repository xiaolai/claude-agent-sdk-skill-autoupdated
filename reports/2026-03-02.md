# Daily Report — 2026-03-02

## Summary

No upstream SDK version changes detected today. Both research agents ran successfully, performing maintenance-only audits (Part A and Part B skipped due to matching version and unavailable GitHub auth). The TypeScript agent corrected a ToC entry ("6 modes" → "5 modes" for PermissionMode); the Python agent refreshed date stamps and ran consistency checks. The typecheck step reported a failure (exit code 1) due to a syntax error in the import-resolution check script itself, though the pipeline outcomes table recorded it as "success" — likely treated as non-blocking.

## Pipeline Status

| Step | Result | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Monitor | success | 4s | No changes detected |
| Auth | success | — | Method: unknown |
| Research (TS) | success | 204s | Doc correction: PermissionMode 6→5 modes |
| Research (PY) | success | 158s | Date stamps refreshed, consistency checks passed |
| Typecheck | failed | 12s | Exit code 1 — import resolution check SyntaxError (see Errors) |
| Update | skipped | — | No version change |
| Verify | skipped | — | No update ran |
| Report | running | — | |

_Note: `outcomes.typecheck` in pipeline log shows "success" despite step `result: "failed"` — likely treated as non-blocking by the pipeline runner._

## Monitor

- **Changes detected**: No
- No upstream changes detected for TypeScript SDK (v0.2.63) or Python SDK (v0.1.44).

## Research

Both research agents ran with GitHub auth unavailable, so Part B (new issue scanning) was skipped for both. Only Part C (consistency/housekeeping) ran.

### TypeScript Research (204s, 67 turns)

- **SDK version**: 0.2.63 (unchanged — Part A skipped)
- **GitHub issues researched**: 0 (Part B skipped — auth unavailable)
- **Changes made**:
  - Fixed ToC entry: "Permissions — 6 modes" → "5 modes" (SDK `PermissionMode` has exactly 5 values)
  - Updated audit summary date to 2026-03-02

### Python Research (158s, 54 turns)

- **SDK version**: 0.1.44 (unchanged — Part A skipped)
- **GitHub issues researched**: 0 (Part B skipped — auth unavailable)
- **Changes made**:
  - Updated "Last verified" footer date from 2026-03-01 → 2026-03-02
  - Updated README.md auto-updated date to 2026-03-02
  - Verified Known Issues #1–#17 are sequential with no duplicates
  - Verified PermissionMode has 4 values matching installed SDK
  - Verified 10 hook events match installed SDK
  - Verified all version references consistent at v0.1.44

## Errors

### Typecheck — Exit Code 1

=========================================

=========================================

TEMPLATE CHECK FAILED — 2 issue(s)
```

**Likely cause**: The import-resolution check script constructed an invalid Python import statement — it included a leading comma after the opening parenthesis: `import (,AgentDefinition,...`. This is a bug in the check script's import-list generation, not an actual template error. All 13 template syntax checks passed; only the dynamic import resolver failed.

**Suggested fix**: Inspect the typecheck script's import-list construction logic to remove the leading comma. The pipeline treated this as non-blocking (outcomes shows "success").
