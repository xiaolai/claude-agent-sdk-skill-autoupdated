# Daily Report — 2026-02-13

## Summary

Version update from v0.2.39 to v0.2.41 completed successfully through update and research phases, but verification failed after 2 mending attempts. The failure was caused by stale version references to v0.2.39 in yesterday's report (2026-02-12.md). Update agent completed in 135s with 57 turns ($0.92), research agent evaluated new issues in 402s with 100 turns ($3.02), and 2 mending attempts ($0.96 combined) were unable to resolve the stale version references in the historical report file.

## Pipeline Status

| Step | Result | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Monitor | success | 3s | Changes detected (v0.2.39 → v0.2.41) |
| Auth | success | — | Authentication successful |
| Update | success | 135s | Version bump applied, 57 turns |
| Research | success | 402s | 100 turns, evaluated new issues |
| Verify | **failed** | 335s | Failed after 2 mending attempts |
| Report | success | — | Current step |

## Monitor

- **Changes detected**: yes
- **Version change**: v0.2.39 → v0.2.41 (2 minor versions)
- No issue state changes detected
- No new bug issues detected

## Update Agent

**Result**: Success

- **Version bump**: v0.2.39 → v0.2.41
- **Turns**: 57
- **Cost**: $0.92
- **Files modified**: 11 files updated with new version number
  - `agent/package.json` — dependency version
  - `agent/state.json` — tracked state
  - `SKILL.md` — documentation and API reference
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin metadata
  - `README.md` — version badge and cost log
  - `rules/claude-agent-sdk.md` — rules file
  - `templates/package.json` — template dependencies
  - `scripts/check-versions.sh` — version check script
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — minor formatting cleanup

**Changes applied**:
- Updated all version references from 0.2.39 to 0.2.41
- Added Known Issue #20 to SKILL.md: "Structured output with Zod requires draft-07 target" (relates to issue #105)
- Updated Zod schema examples in rules to include `{ target: "draft-07" }` parameter
- Added new hook fields to documentation: `notification_type`, `teammate_name`, `team_name`, `task_id`, `task_subject`, `task_description`
- Removed `researchedIssues` section from state.json (cleanup)

## Research

**Result**: Success

- **Turns**: 100
- **Cost**: $3.02
- **Issues evaluated**: Research agent scanned for new issues beyond #172 (last tracked issue)

The research agent ran successfully and completed its evaluation of the issue tracker. No new issues were added to the Known Issues list during this run, suggesting either no new critical issues were found beyond #172, or the agent determined existing issues didn't meet the criteria for inclusion.

## Errors

### Verification Failure

**Step**: Verify (after 2 mending attempts)
**Exit status**: Failed
**Checks passed**: 16/17

**Error details**:
```
Stale version '0.2.39' found in:
/home/runner/work/claude-agent-sdk-skill-autoupdated/claude-agent-sdk-skill-autoupdated/reports/2026-02-12.md:5
/home/runner/work/claude-agent-sdk-skill-autoupdated/claude-agent-sdk-skill-autoupdated/reports/2026-02-12.md:65
```

**Root cause**: The verification script detected version 0.2.39 in yesterday's daily report file (`reports/2026-02-12.md`). This is a **false positive** — historical reports are expected to contain the version numbers that were current at the time they were written.

**Mending attempts**: 2 attempts were made to fix this issue:
- Mending attempt 1: 30 turns, $0.45
- Mending attempt 2: 27 turns, $0.51

Both mending agents completed but were unable to resolve the issue, likely because the verification script incorrectly flags historical report files as needing updates.

**Analysis**: This is a verification script issue, not an update agent issue. The verification logic should exclude historical report files (previous dates) from version checks, as they are intentionally immutable records of past states.

**Suggested fix**: Update `verify.sh` to exclude `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files from stale version checks when the date is not today, or add `reports/*.md` to a verification exclusion list.

## Cost

| Agent | Cost | Turns |
|-------|------|-------|
| Update | $0.92 | 57 |
| Research | $3.02 | 100 |
| Mending (×2) | $0.96 | 57 |
| **Total** | **$4.90** | 214 |

## State

Current tracked state after today's run:

- **SDK version**: v0.2.41 ✓
- **Tracked issues**: 19 open issues (#131, #132, #137, #138, #142, #144, #122, #121, #129, #118, #106, #170, #168, #169, #157, #114, #150, #171, #172, #163)
- **Tracked external issues**: 1 (claude-code #4850)
- **Last scanned issue**: #172
- **Known issues documented**: 20 (#1-#20)
- **Last updated**: 2026-02-13T08:09:55Z

All core documentation and code files successfully updated to v0.2.41. The only verification failure is a false positive in the verification script's handling of historical report files.
