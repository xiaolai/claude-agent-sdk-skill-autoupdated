# Daily Report — 2026-02-19

## Summary

All pipeline steps succeeded. TypeScript SDK was bumped from v0.2.45 → v0.2.47 (two-version jump) and Python SDK from v0.1.37 → v0.1.38. Verification passed on attempt 2 after one mending run. Research agents added 3 new TypeScript Known Issues (#23–#25) and 2 new Python Known Issues (#15–#16), marked TS #13 as fixed in v0.2.40, removed the `delegate` PermissionMode, added a new auto-correction rule for MCP `type: "url"`, and corrected the Python #9 fix version. Total pipeline cost was ~$6.37 across 225 agent turns.

## Update Agent

**TypeScript**: v0.2.45 → v0.2.47

Key changes applied to `SKILL-typescript.md` and `rules/claude-agent-sdk-ts.md`:
- Removed `delegate` from `PermissionMode` union (no longer a valid mode)
- Updated `SDKRateLimitEvent` comment: now documented as causing `SDKMessage → any` type collapse (Known Issue #24)
- `task_notification` message: added `tool_use_id` field to example
- Added 3 new Known Issues (#23, #24, #25 — see Research section)
- Marked Known Issue #13 (`thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }`) as ✅ Fixed in v0.2.40
- Extended Known Issue #22 to note `structuredContent` also affected and reference new issue #187
- Added new auto-correction rule: `type: "url"` is not a valid MCP server transport (use `"http"`)
- Updated changelog table header from v0.2.45 → v0.2.47

**Python**: v0.1.37 → v0.1.38

Key changes applied to `SKILL-python.md`:
- Package version updated throughout
- Added 2 new Known Issues (#15, #16 — see Research section)
- Corrected Known Issue #9 fix version: was "v0.1.37", now correctly "v0.1.36"
- Updated changelog table: v0.1.38 noted as bundling CLI v2.1.47; added v0.1.36 entry for `thinking`/`effort` options
- `Last verified` date updated to 2026-02-19

**Other files modified**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, `scripts/check-versions.sh`, `templates/python/pyproject.toml`, `templates/typescript/package.json`, `agent/state.json`, `rules/claude-agent-sdk-py.md`

**Verification**: Passed on attempt 2 of 2 — 28 checks passed, 0 failures, 0 warnings. One mending run was required before verification succeeded.

## Research

### TypeScript Research

**Issues evaluated**: 3 new issues researched (scanned up to #176 previously; current scan covered additional issues)

| Issue | Title | Verdict | Reason |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| #185 | `Query.promptSuggestion()` announced but missing from published package | ✅ Added as Known Issue #23 | Method in release notes but absent from published `sdk.d.ts` |
| #181/#184 | `SDKRateLimitEvent` undefined causes `SDKMessage` to resolve to `any` | ✅ Added as Known Issue #24 | Type referenced in union but never declared; breaks all TypeScript type safety on SDK messages |
| #177 | `unstable_v2 close()` breaks session persistence | ✅ Added as Known Issue #25 | `close()` sends SIGTERM before session data flushed to disk |
| #168 | `thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }` silently disables thinking | Updated to ✅ Fixed in v0.2.40 | No longer an active workaround; marked historical |
| #175/#187 | Large MCP tool output forces filesystem tool dependency | Updated (#22) | Extended to include `structuredContent` case and new issue reference |

New rule added to `rules/claude-agent-sdk-ts.md`:
- `type: "url"` is not a valid MCP server transport type — correct value is `"http"`

### Python Research

**Issues evaluated**: 2 new issues researched + 1 correction applied

| Issue | Title | Verdict | Reason |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| #583 | `rate_limit_event` messages crash `receive_messages()` generator | ✅ Added as Known Issue #15 | Strict message type allowlist causes `MessageParseError` on any rate-limited response, terminating the generator permanently |
| #584 | Session file not flushed before disconnect — resume fails | ✅ Added as Known Issue #16 | CLI writes session files async; `disconnect()` exits before flush completes, leaving stub file |
| #553 | Thinking Blocks Missing with Opus 4.6 | Correction applied (Known Issue #9) | Fix version was incorrectly listed as v0.1.37; corrected to v0.1.36 |
