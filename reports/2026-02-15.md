## Monitor

- **Changes detected**: yes
- **Change types**:
  - GitHub release tags synced (both TypeScript and Python SDKs)
  - Release tags cleared from state (previous: v0.2.42, v0.1.36 → now empty)
- **SDK versions**: No version changes
  - TypeScript SDK remains at v0.2.42
  - Python SDK remains at v0.1.36

## Update Agent

**Result**: Success (no version change)

The update agent ran successfully but did not apply any version changes. This was a state maintenance run to sync GitHub release tag information.

**Files modified**:
- `agent/state.json` — cleared `latestRelease.tag` and `latestRelease.name` for both SDKs, removed `lastAuditSummary` from Python state
- `README.md` — updated last-updated date from 2026-02-14 to 2026-02-15

**Verification**: Passed on first attempt (no mending required)

## Research

### TypeScript Research Agent

**Result**: Success

- **Issues evaluated**: Issue tracking and rule maintenance
- **New rules added**: 1
  - Added rule for `tool()` API requirement: must pass `ZodRawShape` (or `.shape` property), not `ZodObject` instance
  - Explains common mistake where passing `ZodObject` makes `inputSchema` undefined and handler receives only metadata
- **Files modified**:
  - `rules/claude-agent-sdk-ts.md` — added "tool() requires ZodRawShape, not ZodObject" section

### Python Research Agent

**Result**: Success

- **Issues evaluated**: Scanned tracked issues, no new issues or updates required
- **Outcome**: No changes made to known issues or rules
- **Last scanned issue**: #572

## Cost

| Agent | Cost | Turns |
|-------|------|-------|

| Research (TS) | $1.81 | 83 |
| Research (PY) | $1.09 | 46 |
| Report | $0.00 | 1 |
| **Total** | **$3.19** | **154** |
