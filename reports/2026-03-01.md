# Daily Report — 2026-03-01

## Summary

No upstream version changes were detected today. Both research agents completed comprehensive API audits against installed SDK versions. The TypeScript research agent made significant documentation updates to `SKILL-typescript.md` (10 changes for v0.2.63: 2 new message types, 1 new option, 1 new method, `fast_mode_state` additions, and SDKMessage union count corrected 20→22). The Python research agent confirmed `SKILL-python.md` is fully current against v0.1.44, updating only the "Last verified" date. The typecheck step failed with exit code 1 due to a malformed Python import string generated by the check script (comma immediately after opening parenthesis), though the pipeline outcomes object records it as success — a likely inconsistency in outcome tracking.

## Pipeline Status

| Step | Result | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Monitor | success | 7s | No changes detected |
| Auth | success | — | Method: unknown |
| Research (TS) | success | 259s | API audit only; GitHub issues skipped (auth unavailable) |
| Research (PY) | success | 254s | API audit only; GitHub issues skipped (auth unavailable) |
| Typecheck | **failed** | 12s | Exit code 1 — malformed import string in check script; outcomes log says "success" (inconsistency) |
| Update | skipped | — | No version change detected |
| Verify | skipped | — | Update was skipped |
| Report | running | — | |

## Monitor

- **Changes detected**: no
- No upstream changes detected for either TypeScript SDK (currently v0.2.63) or Python SDK (currently v0.1.44).

## Research

Both research agents ran successfully. GitHub issues research (Part B) was skipped for both due to GitHub auth being unavailable this run. Only the API audit (Part A) ran.

### TypeScript Research (v0.2.63)

Full audit of `SKILL-typescript.md` against the installed SDK. **10 updates applied**:

| # | Change |
|---|--------|
| 1 | Added `onElicitation` option to Advanced Options table |
| 2 | Added `supportedAgents()` to Query Object Methods |
| 3 | Added `SDKLocalCommandOutputMessage` to SDKMessage union (was missing) |
| 4 | Added `SDKElicitationCompleteMessage` to SDKMessage union (was missing) |
| 5 | Fixed SDKMessage union count: 20 → 22; removed stale 'not exported' comments for `SDKRateLimitEvent` / `SDKPromptSuggestionMessage` |
| 6 | Updated TOC: "20 types (2 undefined)" → "22 types"; "18 hook events" → "20 hook events" |
| 7 | Added `agents` and `fast_mode_state` to `SDKControlInitializeResponse` |
| 8 | Added `fast_mode_state` to `SDKSystemMessage` and `SDKResultMessage` docs |
| 9 | Added `local_command_output` and `elicitation_complete` to Streaming Pattern example |
| 10 | Clarified `reason?` as top-level field in hook return values |

No new GitHub issues researched (auth unavailable).

### Python Research (v0.1.44)

Full audit of `SKILL-python.md` against the installed SDK. All 37 `ClaudeAgentOptions` fields, 12 `ClaudeSDKClient` methods, 10 hook events, 5 message types, and all exported types confirmed accurate. All 13 Python templates pass import validation. **1 update applied**:

- Updated "Last verified" footer date from 2026-02-28 to 2026-03-01

No new GitHub issues researched (auth unavailable). KI #15 fix (rate_limit_event) already documented as fixed in v0.1.44.

## Errors

### Typecheck — Exit Code 1

**Last output:**
```
  OK:   query_with_tools.py — valid syntax
  OK:   sandbox_config.py — valid syntax
  OK:   session_management.py — valid syntax
  OK:   structured_output.py — valid syntax
  OK:   subagents_orchestration.py — valid syntax

=========================================
  Passed: 13
  Failed: 2
=========================================

TEMPLATE CHECK FAILED — 2 issue(s)
```

**Likely cause:** The typecheck script generates a Python import statement by joining symbol names with commas, but the resulting string has a leading comma immediately after the opening parenthesis (e.g., `import (,AgentDefinition,...`). This is a bug in the import string construction within the typecheck script itself, not in the templates or SDK.

**Note:** The pipeline `outcomes` object records `"typecheck": "success"` despite the step showing `"result": "failed"` with exit code 1. This inconsistency suggests the outcome may have been overwritten or the typecheck is treated as non-blocking in the outcome aggregation.

**Suggested fix:** Investigate the typecheck script's import string builder for an off-by-one or array join issue producing a leading comma. All 13 templates passed individual syntax validation — only the combined import resolution check failed.
