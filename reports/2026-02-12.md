### Issues Researched

1. **Issue #171**: "unstable_v2_createSession() doesn't support plugins option"
   - **Verdict**: Added as Known Issue #18
   - **Reason**: Well-documented API limitation affecting v2 sessions with plugins, no workaround except using query() API
   - **Impact**: Users of the v2 session API cannot use plugins; must fall back to the standard query() API

2. **Issue #172**: "AgentDefinition.tools and disallowedTools not enforced for subagents"
   - **Verdict**: Added as Known Issue #19 (merged with #163)
   - **Reason**: Security/isolation issue with subagents, affects common use case, has functional workaround via hooks
   - **Impact**: Subagents can call tools they shouldn't have access to, potentially causing infinite recursion
   - **Workaround**: Documented use of `PreToolUse` hook with `canUseTool` callback to block disallowed tools

3. **Issue #152**: "Bug: Calling close() before first assistant message makes session non-resumable"
   - **Verdict**: Skipped
   - **Reason**: Fixed in latest SDK version per user confirmation
   - **Impact**: None, issue resolved in current version
