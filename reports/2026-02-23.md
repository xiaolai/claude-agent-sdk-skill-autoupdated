# Daily Report — 2026-02-23

## Summary

No upstream SDK version changes detected today. Both research agents ran successfully: the TypeScript agent performed an API audit updating 6 skill doc entries for v0.2.50, and the Python agent evaluated 2 new issues (#603, #604) and added the `transport` parameter to `ClaudeSDKClient.__init__` docs. The typecheck step reported a failure (exit code 1) due to a bug in the import-resolution checker script itself — all 13 template files passed — and the pipeline outcome was recorded as "success" (non-blocking). Update and verify were skipped (no version change).

| Research (PY) | success | 247s | 2 issues evaluated, 1 method doc added |
| Typecheck | ⚠️ failed (non-blocking) | 11s | Exit code 1 — import checker script bug; all templates passed |
| Update | skipped | — | No version change |

## Research

### TypeScript (v0.2.50 audit)

No new GitHub issues scanned (lastScannedIssueNumber remains 194). Agent performed a documentation audit of v0.2.50 and updated 6 entries in `SKILL-typescript.md`:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `ThinkingEnabled.budgetTokens` | Corrected to optional (`budgetTokens?: number`) |
| `env` option description | Added `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CLIENT_APP` User-Agent tip |
| `SDKStatusMessage` | Added `permissionMode?: PermissionMode` field |
| `SDKTaskStartedMessage` | Added `task_type?: string` field |
| `SDKToolProgressMessage` | Added `task_id?: string` field |
| `SDKTaskNotificationMessage` | Added `output_file`, `summary`, `usage` fields |
| V2 Limitations section | Clarified what `SDKSessionOptions` now supports (permissionMode, allowedTools, disallowedTools, canUseTool, hooks) vs. what's still missing (cwd, settingSources, bypassPermissions) |
| Known Issue #21 | Updated from "ignores critical options" to "has limited option support" — reflects partial resolution in v0.2.50 |

**New known issues added**: 0 | **Entries updated**: 6

### Python (v0.1.39)

**Issues evaluated**: 2 (scanned #603–#604)

| Issue | Title | Verdict | Reason |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| [#603](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/603) | rate_limit_event causes MessageParseError instead of being handled gracefully | `updated_existing` (KI #15) | Duplicate of #601/#583; added #603 link to KI #15 and noted PR #598 merged fix (pending release) |
| [#604](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/604) | [SECURITY] Edit tool reads file content before PreToolUse hook validation | `skipped` | Security edge case, 0 reactions, 0 comments; no SDK-level workaround; drastic mitigation (disable Edit tool) not appropriate for docs |

**Audit updates**:
- `ClaudeSDKClient.__init__` signature: added missing `transport: Transport | None = None` parameter
- Known Issue #15: added #603 link and PR #598 merge status note

**New known issues added**: 0 | **Entries updated**: 1 (KI #15) | **Methods added**: 1

## Errors

### Typecheck — exit code 1 (non-blocking)

The typecheck step failed with exit code 1, but the pipeline outcome was recorded as "success" (indicating this step is non-blocking). All 13 template files passed their checks.

**Failure output** (last 15 lines):
```
=== Python import resolution check ===
  File "<string>", line 1
    from claude_agent_sdk import (,AgentDefinition,ClaudeAgentOptions,...
                                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  FAIL: Some template imports don't resolve
  FAIL:   Cannot import: (

=========================================
  Passed: 13
  Failed: 2
=========================================

TEMPLATE CHECK FAILED — 2 issue(s)
```

**Likely cause**: The import resolution checker script is generating malformed Python syntax — a spurious leading comma after `(` — when building the test import statement. This is a bug in the typecheck script itself, not in any template file.

**Suggested fix**: Inspect the import resolution checker script and fix the logic that concatenates the import list. The comma is likely inserted before the first element instead of between elements.
