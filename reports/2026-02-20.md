# Daily Report — 2026-02-20

## Summary

Full pipeline success: TypeScript SDK updated from v0.2.47 → v0.2.49 and Python SDK from v0.1.38 → v0.1.39. Verify passed on attempt 2 after 1 mending run. Research agents updated documentation for both SDKs — TypeScript gained a new `ConfigChange` hook event, `promptSuggestions` option, and `SDKPromptSuggestionMessage` type (now 19 message types, 16 hook events); Python gained Known Issue #17 (hardcoded `ProcessError.stderr`) and an expanded Known Issue #16 (session flush timing on NFS). Total pipeline duration: ~17 minutes.

## Research

### TypeScript

Documentation updated for v0.2.49 changes. No new GitHub issues tracked beyond #176 (lastScannedIssueNumber unchanged).

Key documentation changes:
- **New `promptSuggestions` option** added to Options table: emits `SDKPromptSuggestionMessage` after each turn with predicted next user prompt
- **`SDKPromptSuggestionMessage`** added to message types union (18 → 19 types); note: type not exported in `sdk.d.ts`, contributes to `any` resolution (Known Issue #24)
- **`ConfigChange` hook event** added (15 → 16 events): fires when settings files change (user/project/local/policy/skills), includes `source` and optional `file_path` fields
- **`ModelInfo` expanded**: added `supportsEffort`, `supportedEffortLevels`, `supportsAdaptiveThinking` fields
- **Known Issue #23 updated**: `Query.promptSuggestion()` still missing from published package in v0.2.49
- **Known Issue #24 expanded**: `SDKPromptSuggestionMessage` added as second undefined type in the `SDKMessage` union; workaround updated with ambient declaration for both types
- **Hook payload docs updated**: added `last_assistant_message` field on Stop/SubagentStop; fixed `PreCompact` trigger type (`'manual' | 'auto'`); added `ConfigChange` payload fields
- **Changelog highlight**: v0.2.49 entry added

### Python

Documentation updated for v0.1.39 changes. No new GitHub issues scanned beyond #580.

Key documentation changes:
- **Known Issue #17 added**: `ProcessError.stderr` always contains hardcoded string `"Check stderr output for details"` instead of actual CLI error output ([#529](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/529)). Workaround: use `stderr` callback option to capture real output.
- **Known Issue #16 expanded**: Session file flush timing issue now includes NFS/shared storage guidance (use 3+ second sleep), and notes that resume may silently create a new session rather than just having a stub file ([#555](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/555) added)
- **Changelog highlight**: v0.1.39 entry updated (bundled CLI → v2.1.49)
- **Version references**: Updated throughout to v0.1.39
